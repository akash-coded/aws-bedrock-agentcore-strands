## Why this exists

Most agentic AI material stops at a working demo. A demo is the easy 20%. The hard part is everything
after: proving the thing works, knowing what it costs, deciding whether it should have been an agent at
all, and having something to roll back to when it fails at 2 a.m.

This curriculum was built and delivered across three professional cohorts and rebuilt for public use. It is
opinionated in one specific way:

> **Every abstraction is preceded by the thing it abstracts.**
> You write the agent loop by hand before you meet a framework. You build RAG by hand before you touch a
> managed knowledge base. You write the evaluation gate before you deploy. Nothing is magic, because you
> built the layer underneath it.

## What you will be able to do

- Decide, with a defensible artefact, whether a use case should be an agent at all
- Call Amazon Bedrock properly — Converse API, tool use, multi-turn state, token accounting
- Build agents in **Bedrock Agents**, **Strands** and **LangChain/LangGraph**, and choose between them with evidence
- Design multi-agent topologies and predict their cost before running them
- Build a retrieval pipeline with hybrid search and reranking, and **prove** it works
- Deploy to **Bedrock AgentCore** with memory, identity, a gateway and observability
- Gate a release on evaluation metrics, and roll it back when the gate is right

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akash-coded/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands.git
cd aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

Then open **[`docs/START-HERE.md`](docs/START-HERE.md)**.

> **Before Module 02:** [set up AWS](docs/setup/aws-account-setup.md) and
> [set a budget alarm](docs/setup/cost-controls.md). Model access approval is not always instant.
> Modules 00, 01 and 15 need no AWS account — start there while access is pending.

## How a module works

Every module has the same shape, and its `README.md` tells you the exact order to work through it.

```
modules/NN-topic/
├── README.md      ← objectives, the ordered sequence, common mistakes. Start here.
├── slides/        ← decks and reading material
├── notebooks/     ← runnable code

├── activities/    ← workbooks where a decision gets written down and costed
├── src/           ← supporting source code
└── labs/          ← extended hands-on
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR

    S -->|yes| SOL["📗 Compare with<br/>solution"]
    S -->|no| W["📊 Workbook<br/>decide and cost it"]
    SOL --> W --> N["Next module"]
```

### 63 worked solutions — and honesty about the rest

Most exercises ship with a worked solution, written to be read **after** you have a wrong answer to compare
against. That comparison is where the learning is; reading them first turns an hour of work into five
minutes of nodding.

Where there is no answer key, it is deliberate and the module says so:
[Module 06](modules/06-strands-foundations/)'s builds are open-ended designs with levels and
acceptance criteria rather than one right implementation, and
[Module 11](modules/11-bedrock-agentcore/)'s exercises are graded against a self-check rubric.
No module claims a solution set it does not have.

---

## One example, all the way through

**TravelMind** is a travel-operations agent, and it is in almost every module. It starts in Module 02 as a
single Bedrock call and finishes in Module 14 as a deployed, gated, multi-agent service with failover and a
rollback path. Same domain throughout, so you are never learning a new business problem at the same time as
a new technical concept.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

## Portable skills vs AWS specifics

A fair question about any cloud-branded curriculum: how much of this transfers?

Most of it. The curriculum is deliberately front-loaded with portable material, and the AWS-specific
surface is concentrated in the platform layer.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 🟢 **[Portable GenAI concepts](docs/concepts/genai-core-concepts.md)** | Agent loops, tool design, memory strategy, RAG pipeline design, multi-agent topologies, evaluation and gating. Transfers to any stack. |
| 🔵 **[Where AWS comes in](docs/concepts/aws-service-map.md)** | Bedrock, AgentCore, Knowledge Bases, Guardrails, OpenSearch, Lambda, IAM, CloudWatch — service by service, with the module that teaches each. |
| ⚖️ **[Portability matrix](docs/concepts/portability-matrix.md)** | An honest, itemised answer on lock-in, and how to structure a build so the lock-in stays narrow. |

---

## 🗺️ The Field Guide

The curriculum teaches you to build agents. The **[field guide](cheatsheets/)** is what you reach for once
you are building them — in a design review, at 2 a.m. during an incident, in a budget meeting, or in an
interview.

| Section | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| 🧠 **[Frameworks](cheatsheets/frameworks/)** | 17 original mental models — the [Autonomy Ladder](cheatsheets/frameworks/autonomy-ladder.md), [Token Tax Ledger](cheatsheets/frameworks/token-tax-ledger.md), [Handoff Multiplier](cheatsheets/frameworks/handoff-multiplier.md), [Blast Radius Grid](cheatsheets/frameworks/blast-radius-grid.md), [Evidence Ladder](cheatsheets/frameworks/evidence-ladder.md) and more. Each has a procedure and an output, not just a concept |
| 📖 **[Quick reference](cheatsheets/quick-reference/)** | 10 cheat sheets: [Bedrock Converse](cheatsheets/quick-reference/bedrock-converse.md), [Strands](cheatsheets/quick-reference/strands.md), [LangGraph](cheatsheets/quick-reference/langgraph.md), [AgentCore](cheatsheets/quick-reference/agentcore.md), [RAG](cheatsheets/quick-reference/rag-pipeline.md), [IAM](cheatsheets/quick-reference/iam-for-agents.md), [observability](cheatsheets/quick-reference/observability.md) |
| 🚨 **[Runbooks](cheatsheets/runbooks/)** | 9 procedures for when it breaks — [wrong answers](cheatsheets/runbooks/incident-wrong-answers.md), [cost spikes](cheatsheets/runbooks/incident-cost-spike.md), [runaway loops](cheatsheets/runbooks/incident-runaway-loop.md), [rollback](cheatsheets/runbooks/rollback.md), [inheriting an agent](cheatsheets/runbooks/inheriting-an-agent.md) |
| 📋 **[Playbooks](cheatsheets/playbooks/)** | [Design reviews](cheatsheets/playbooks/agent-design-review.md), [build-buy-or-wait](cheatsheets/playbooks/build-buy-or-wait.md), [scoping an engagement](cheatsheets/playbooks/scoping-an-engagement.md), [killing a project well](cheatsheets/playbooks/killing-an-agent-project.md) |
| 💼 **[Interview guides](cheatsheets/interviews/)** | Both sides of the table for [engineer](cheatsheets/interviews/agent-engineer.md), [architect](cheatsheets/interviews/solutions-architect.md), [PM](cheatsheets/interviews/product-manager.md), [BA](cheatsheets/interviews/business-analyst.md), [QA](cheatsheets/interviews/qa-engineer.md) — plus a [hiring guide](cheatsheets/interviews/as-the-interviewer.md) |
| 🎓 **[How-to by role](cheatsheets/how-to/)** | 17 recipes for [engineers](cheatsheets/how-to/engineers/), [PMs](cheatsheets/how-to/product/), [architects](cheatsheets/how-to/architects/), [business analysts](cheatsheets/how-to/business-analysts/), [QA](cheatsheets/how-to/qa-and-test/) and [engineering managers](cheatsheets/how-to/engineering-managers/) |

**Not only for engineers.** Product managers get [acceptance criteria for non-deterministic systems](cheatsheets/how-to/product/write-acceptance-criteria.md)
and [how to price a feature](cheatsheets/how-to/product/price-an-agent-feature.md). Business analysts get
[how to build a golden set from real tickets](cheatsheets/how-to/business-analysts/build-a-golden-set.md) —
the artefact that *is* the specification. Architects get [topology selection with cost multipliers](cheatsheets/how-to/architects/choose-a-topology.md).

## 🧪 The L.A.B. Simulator

**Learn → Apply → Break.** Auto-graded, bite-sized labs where you build the pieces yourself and then try
to break them. No API keys, no dependencies — every lab runs offline on Python 3.11+.

**[Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/akash-coded/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands?quickstart=1)** and type `lab next` — that is the entire setup. Or locally:

```bash
python labs/runner/labctl.py next          # what you can start right now
python labs/runner/labctl.py start PDL-01
python labs/runner/labctl.py run   PDL-01  # public checks
python labs/runner/labctl.py break PDL-01  # now survive the failures that end real runs
```

Most practice platforms give you a stub and a happy-path test. Agents do not fail on the happy path — they
fail when a tool returns `[]` and the model reads it as "nothing applies". So every lab has three phases:

| | Phase | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L** | Learn | A mental model, a diagram, and **one decision with the answer withheld**. Your choice changes what you build |
| **A** | Apply | A spec, public checks you can see, hidden checks on submit. Every check explains what it teaches when it fails |
| **B** | Break | `SystemExit` from a library. A chunk bigger than the whole budget. A footnote `[1]` corrupting your citation map. Survive them |

**[10 labs and 9 drills across 8 tracks](labs/)**, ordered by a [justified pathway](labs/PATHWAY.md) — and the decision
inside each one accumulates into the [seven PRD artefacts](docs/prd/), so you finish with a working system
*and* the paperwork to defend it.

Or skip the clone entirely: post `/drill AGL-101` with a python block in the
[Simulator Arena](labs/ARENA.md) and a bot grades it in the thread, names the skill you demonstrated, and points
at the next one. Trainers `/assign`; progress lands on the [scoreboard](https://github.com/akash-coded/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/wiki/Scoreboard) and the
[Hands-on Tracker](https://github.com/users/akash-coded/projects/9).

The catalog is **self-verifying**: CI proves every reference solution passes all three phases and every
starter fails, so no lab can ship with TODOs that do not need doing. Fork the repo, commit your solutions,
and [the workflow grades your pull request](.github/workflows/labs.yml).

## 📘 The agentic manual — your role, end to end

**[https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/)**

An operating manual for building software that decides. You enter by **role** and walk it from the
first discovery conversation to the number you report at the end. Five roles, forty steps,
**264 sub-steps** — and at every single step: what you actually do, where a model helps and where it
must not be trusted, the artefact you produce, a fill-in **template**, copy-paste **prompts**, a worked
example, the pitfalls, and a testable done-when.

| Role | The arc | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Product manager](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/product-manager/)** | Discover → Qualify → Frame → Specify → Plan → Gate → Launch → Learn | From a vibe to a number you can defend |
| **[Solution architect](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/solution-architect/)** | Elicit → Constrain → Map → Shape → Decide → Bound → Detail → Evolve | From requirements to a system that holds |
| **[Engineering lead](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/engineering/)** | Prepare → Slice → Floor → Layer → Gate → Harness → Ship → Operate | From a story file to a shipped bolt |
| **[QA lead](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/qa/)** | Define → Curate → Check → Harness → Measure → Attack → Shadow → Watch | From "it works" to a number you can defend |
| **[DevOps and platform](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/devops/)** | Baseline → Access → Environments → Pipeline → Deploy → Observe → Protect → Recover | From a laptop to production, repeatably |

Each role gets its own arc, because the shape of the work differs. One running case throughout —
**SkyWays**, an airline building a rebooking assistant for disrupted passengers — so you can switch
roles and stay oriented.

**[📋 All 40 templates](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/templates/)** &nbsp;·&nbsp;
**[💬 All 116 prompts](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/prompts/)** &nbsp;·&nbsp;

[![The agentic manual](docs/assets/skyways-architect.png)](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/)

The **[simulator](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/simulator/)** is the same case, playable: thirteen dated episodes, eight loops,
nine simulations where a wrong choice plays out in front of you, and seventeen calculators that do the
arithmetic on your own numbers. The **[wiki](https://github.com/akash-coded/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/wiki/The-Agentic-PDLC)** carries the method in writing,
and every journey has a [reading copy](https://github.com/akash-coded/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/wiki/Journey-Product-Manager) there too.

## Design documents

Because "how do I design one of these" is the question the demos never answer.

| Document | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| **[Architecture HLD](docs/architecture/)** | The whole system: curriculum structure, TravelMind reference architecture, request lifecycle, cost model |
| **[LLD per module](docs/architecture/lld/)** | 16 zoom-ins: the mechanism, its components, contracts, failure modes and how you detect each |
| **[Sample PRDs](docs/prd/)** | Seven artefacts across the lifecycle — idea brief, discovery PRD, agent spec, technical design, evaluation plan, production readiness, post-launch review. Worked for TravelMind, usable as templates. |
| **[Glossary](docs/concepts/glossary.md)** | Terms as used here, including where the industry definition is contested |
| **[Training frameworks playbook](docs/reference/training-frameworks-playbook.md)** | The instructional design behind the structure, if you want to teach from this |

## Prerequisites

**You need:** enough Python to read and modify a function, and an AWS account you are allowed to spend on.

**You do not need:** machine learning background, maths, or prior LLM experience. Module 01 builds the
model intuition from zero.

**Cost:** tens of dollars if you tear down as you go; considerably more if you leave OpenSearch Serverless
collections and AgentCore runtimes running. Read **[cost controls](docs/setup/cost-controls.md)** first —
it has a teardown checklist per module.

AWS moves quickly. If something here no longer matches reality, that is a bug worth reporting.

## Running this repository · secrets

**If you are here to learn, you need no secrets, tokens or API keys.** Nothing in the curriculum, the
labs, the field guide or the playbook asks for one. This is for whoever maintains the repository.

There are two, and only the first is in use.

| | Secret | What it is | What happens without it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🔑 | **`PROJECT_TOKEN`** — GitHub Actions secret | A **classic** PAT, **`project` scope only**. Powers the [Hands-on Tracker](https://github.com/users/akash-coded/projects/9) and [Repo Pulse](https://github.com/users/akash-coded/projects/10) boards | Those two boards stop refreshing. The [scoreboard](https://github.com/akash-coded/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/wiki/Scoreboard), `/leaderboard`, `/progress`, the weekly digest and the PDLC board all keep working |
| 📮 | The relay's **mirror token** — AWS Secrets Manager | A **fine-grained** PAT limited to one private repository, *Issues: read and write*. Only for the [contact relay](site/contact-relay/README.md) | Not in use — the relay is not deployed, and the site's form opens the visitor's mail app instead |

Two things worth knowing about the first one. It **cannot** be a fine-grained token: those have no
permission covering *user-owned* Projects, and neither has the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. And when it
expires **the workflow does not fail** — it warns and the scoreboard still publishes, deliberately, so
the signal is a board that has stopped moving rather than a red run.

## Frequently asked

**Do I need an AWS account?** For most of it. Modules 00, 01 and 15 need nothing.
**Strands or LangChain?** Both are here, compared head-to-head on the same task in [Module 08](modules/08-langchain-and-langgraph/).
**Are there videos?** Not yet — the written material is self-contained. [Progress is tracked here](docs/reference/video-index.md).
**Can I teach from this?** Yes, MIT licensed. See [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff).
**Do I need any API keys or tokens?** No. The one secret here is for maintainers and affects two boards only.
