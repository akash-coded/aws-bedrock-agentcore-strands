# Editing this wiki

Anyone with repository access can edit any page — click **Edit** at the top right. No pull request, no review queue. That is the point of a wiki, and it is why only certain things live here.

## What belongs here

| ✅ Here | ❌ In the repository |
| --- | --- |
| Things that change monthly ([region notes](Model-and-Region-Notes)) | The curriculum, labs, and field guide |
| Community-contributed data ([cost log](Cost-Log)) | Anything that ships with the code |
| Cross-surface navigation ([where do I find it](Where-do-I-find-it)) | Anything needing review before it is trusted |
| Growing collections ([error index](Error-Index)) | Anything a CI check validates |
| Calendar-shaped guidance ([study plans](Study-Plans)) | The role-based learning paths |

**The test:** *would being slightly wrong for a week be acceptable?* If yes, wiki. If no, it belongs in the repo behind a review.

**Pages that say *generated* at the top are written by a script** from a source in the repository — the tutorial index from `site/content/learn/`, the course companion from `modules/` and `labs/`. Edit the source; the page's footer links it. An edit made on the wiki is replaced at the next export, and the Wiki edits workflow opens an issue telling you where the source is.

**Never duplicate a repo page here.** Two copies drift, and the wiki copy is the one people find by search — so the wiki becomes the wrong answer. Link instead. If a repo page is hard to find, that is a job for [Where do I find…?](Where-do-I-find-it), not a copy.

## House style

Matching the repository's:

- **Plain and direct.** Say the thing. No throat-clearing.
- **Name the failure mode.** "This breaks when X" beats "be careful".
- **Numbers with denominators.** "87% on a 130-case set" not "very accurate".
- **Absolute links to the repo** — `https://github.com/akash-coded/…/blob/main/…`. Wiki pages are not in the repo tree, so relative links break.
- **Wiki-internal links use the page name**: `[Error Index](Error-Index)`.
- **Date anything volatile.** A region note with no date is a rumour.

## Adding to the high-traffic pages

**[Error Index](Error-Index)** — the most valuable page to contribute to.

```markdown
### `the exact error string, including punctuation`
**Cause.** What is actually wrong.
**Fix.** The command or change.
**How you found it.** ← the line people skip and everyone else needs.
```

Paste the exact string. People arrive here from a search engine with an error in their clipboard.

**[Cost Log](Cost-Log)** — add a row after finishing a module. Include whether you tore down the same day; it changes the number more than anything else.

**[Community Answers](Community-Answers)** — when a Q&A thread gets a good answer, add a one-sentence summary that is useful *without clicking through*.

**[Model & Region Notes](Model-and-Region-Notes)** — always with a date and what you actually verified.

## Adding a page

Keep it small. A wiki with 40 pages is a wiki nobody reads.

Before adding, check: could this be a section on an existing page? Usually yes.

If you do add one: add it to [`_Sidebar`](_Sidebar) and link it from [Home](Home). An unlinked wiki page does not exist.

## Reverting

Every wiki edit is a git commit — see the page history, revert anything. Wikis are lower-stakes than they feel.

## Not sure?

Edit anyway. A wrong edit is visible and fixable; a correction nobody made because they were unsure is neither.

Bigger questions belong in [Discussions](https://github.com/akash-coded/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/discussions/categories/general).
