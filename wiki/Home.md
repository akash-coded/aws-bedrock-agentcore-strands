# The map

Five surfaces, ~800 files and a wiki that is now a playbook in its own right. This page exists because
no single surface can point at the other four.

## The three things worth knowing before you start

**1. Model access is not automatic.** It is granted per model, *per region*, on request, and approval is not always instant. Start [AWS setup](https://github.com/akash-coded/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/blob/main/docs/setup/aws-account-setup.md) before you need it.

**2. Two things bill for existing, not for use.** OpenSearch Serverless collections and AgentCore runtimes. They are what people leave running by accident. [Teardown checklist](https://github.com/akash-coded/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/blob/main/docs/setup/cost-controls.md#teardown-checklist).

**3. A lot of this needs no AWS account at all.** Modules 00, 01 and 15, every [L.A.B. lab](https://github.com/akash-coded/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/tree/main/labs), `rag_by_hand.py` and `quality_gate.py`. That is 20+ hours of real work at zero cost while your model access is pending.

## What is on this wiki, and what is not

The repository is **canonical**: versioned, reviewed, and it ships with the code. Do not look for the curriculum here.

This wiki is the **connective and volatile layer** — the cross-surface maps, and the notes that would be embarrassing to freeze in a reviewed file:

| Page | Why it lives here |
| --- | --- |
| [The playbook pages](The-Agentic-PDLC) | The method behind the [live simulator](https://akash-coded.github.io/aws-bedrock-agentcore-strands/), in writing. It changes as the practice does, and anyone can correct a number |
| [Error Index](Error-Index) | Grows every time somebody hits a new one. No PR needed |
| [Model & Region Notes](Model-and-Region-Notes) | Availability changes monthly; a versioned file would be wrong within a quarter |
| [Cost Log](Cost-Log) | Real measured numbers from real people, not estimates |
| [Community Answers](Community-Answers) | Curated from discussions as they get answered |
| [Study Plans](Study-Plans) | Calendar-shaped, and everyone's calendar differs |
| [Maintainer Runbook](Maintainer-Runbook) | How the repo is run — not learner-facing |

**Anyone can edit these.** That is the point. [How to](Contributing-to-this-Wiki).
