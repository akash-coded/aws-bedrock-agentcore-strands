# ⚙️ Module 11 · Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

> Runtime, memory, identity, gateway, observability — agents as deployed services.

**Estimated time:** 8–10 hours &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Prerequisites:** Modules 05–06. Module 08 for the LangGraph deployment.

Everything so far ran in a notebook. AgentCore is how an agent becomes a service with an identity, a memory store, a gateway, traces and a bill. This module deploys agents three ways — Strands, LangGraph, and no framework at all — so you can see the runtime is framework-agnostic.

---

## What you will be able to do

- Deploy an agent to AgentCore Runtime and invoke it as a service
- Wire AgentCore Memory and reason about retention
- Configure identity and tool access with least privilege
- Route traffic through the gateway and read the traces
- Estimate runtime cost and capacity before you commit

## Project artefact

`src/MyFirstRuntimeAgent` is a complete CDK-managed AgentCore project — app code, infrastructure, and configuration.

## Solutions

**These exercises are graded against a rubric rather than an answer key.** Each one is a fresh domain
(not TravelMind) with layered Base / Stretch / Advanced targets, and each ends with:

- a **self-check rubric** scored out of 100, so you can grade your own work honestly
- a **pass/fail LLM-integrated task** that is required regardless of how far you got
- **facilitator and TA notes** in an appendix, if you are running this for a group

[`README_exercises.md`](exercises/README_exercises.md) explains how the three map onto the notebooks.

## Common mistakes

- Deploying without a memory retention decision. Storage grows, and so does the bill.
- Over-broad IAM on the runtime role. Scope tools to what the agent actually needs.
- Skipping observability until something breaks in production.
